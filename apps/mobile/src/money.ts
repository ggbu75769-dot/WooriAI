/**
 * Round 5A D0 money-format helper (docs/5차/round5a-design-spec.md §D0 "타이포 (금액 규칙)").
 *
 * Single source of truth for rendering KRW amounts as "12,000원" (comma-grouped, '원' suffix,
 * no '₩'). Uses `Intl.NumberFormat('ko-KR')` per the spec rather than a hand-rolled regex.
 *
 * Amounts are always rendered as their absolute value -- this helper never emits a leading "-".
 * Sign (income/refund vs. expense) is a presentation concern handled by the caller, not by the
 * number formatter itself.
 *
 * (MOB-121 removed the D0 `MoneyText` component and, with it, this module's only caller of the
 * split number/suffix variant; `formatKrwParts`/`MoneyKrwParts` were dropped in R19-E as dead
 * exports. The money type scale those two rendered lives on in `theme.money`, which `ui/ListRow`
 * still consumes.)
